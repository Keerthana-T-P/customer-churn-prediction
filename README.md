# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using a random forests classifier. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains information about customers, including features like tenure, charges, and service-related attributes.
- The target variable is 'Churn' (whether a customer churned or not).

## Steps
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a random forests classifier.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy and F1 score.
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

## How to Run
1. Install required Python packages (pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn).
2. Run the provided code.
3. Check the accuracy, F1 score, and best model details.
